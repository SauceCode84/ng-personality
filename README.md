Welcome to **ng-personality**!

This is web app determines your [Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator) personality type. The app uses a questionnaire based on the set of questions from the book **Please Understand Me II** by *David Keirsey*, which is his *Temperament Sorter* self-assessment. Although different, this is very closely linked to the MBTI personality theory.

## How it works?
The user answers a set of questions, each of which have only two (2) possible answers. There is no right or wrong answer and there is no time limit, although the test shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to complete.

Once the user has answered all the questions, their personality type is determined based on the answers given. The result is stored and the user can view their assessments(s) at any time and also take the test again to compare.
